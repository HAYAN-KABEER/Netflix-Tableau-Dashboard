# 🎬 Netflix Dashboard in Tableau

This repository contains my **first Tableau project**, where I built an interactive dashboard on Netflix data to practice real-world data visualization and dashboard building skills.  

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal was to analyze Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset and uncover insights about viewing trends.  

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used
- Tableau (Data Cleaning, Transformation & Visualization)
- Dashboard building by combining multiple charts

## 📝 Steps Followed
1. Cleaned and prepared the dataset  
2. Built separate charts for:  
   - Movies vs TV Shows  
   - Ratings distribution  
   - Genre distribution  
   - Yearly trends  
3. Combined the charts into one interactive dashboard  

## ✅ Key Insights
- **Movies are watched significantly more than TV Shows** on Netflix.  

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on practice in Tableau dashboard development  
- Learned how to combine multiple visualizations into a meaningful story
